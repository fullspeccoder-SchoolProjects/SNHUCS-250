## How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

---

Interpreting user needs and implementing them into a program is done through the Product Backlog which have items called User Stories. These User Stories are created from a template such as "As a [user], I want [an action] so that [benefit/value].". These User Stories are important because we are identifying who is going to be doing what action to get some benefit or value for that particular feature. Sometimes there are general needs that could be broad, these would be called epics that would eventually get borken down into smaller User Stories to complete for important features.

## How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

---

I would approach developing programs by planning what the major features of a program would be, so that I have a basic understanding of what I would need to do to come up with the details later for those said features. I would incorporate agile processes such as Sprint Planning and User Stories into my future development along with using some of the estimation processes to help in developing a priority list that would help me stay on task to complete my work.

## What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

---

Being a good team member would mean to be able to communicate and collaborate effectively to complete customer demands of what they want into the product. Being able to deliver high quality products is essential to being a good team member in an organization. A good team member will constantly think about what they could improve the next day and weeks to come in order to complete the product.
